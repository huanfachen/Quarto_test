Note that we can do useful things like inserting a module name Module Name (casaXXXX) dynamically. This can be especially useful for submission deadlines which are stated on multiple pages of a web site.\nWe also have a presentation style that you can use.\nEverywhere in-line code execution is supported, as are included QMD files and other tricks to make it easy to re-use content, streamline maintenance of your moduleâ€™s materials, and keep everything nice and clean.",
